    <div class="news">
        <p> Leo Messi attended a joint interview in Paris with Mundo Deportivo and Sport in which he revealed his decision. The Argentine star, who is free from a contract, will not sign for Barça in the end because he missed a proposal but he points out that it was not a formal offer. Many things were missing and he wanted to own his future and decide quickly, not having to wait like in 2021, for fear of another disappointment. And although he says he doesn't have it closed one hundred percent, his decision is to go to Inter Miami . In the interview with Mundo Deportivo and Sport , LeoHe talks about how he has lived in Paris, about his departure in 2021, which he describes as very hard and very ugly, and explains the reasons for not returning to Barça . Among them, that she does not want to be held responsible for player sales or salary reductions, and her desire to enjoy football outside of the pressure that exists in Europe . She also points out that she would like to return to Barça , she does not know in what position. It's Leo 's version of everything that's been talked about for months and months.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. How does Messi feel?</h3>
        <p>Good. I feel good, calm, having already finished the season. It was an atypical year for having played the World Cup in the middle. He made that make everything different. Thinking now about the matches with the national team and the holiday.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Now the season is over, he is leaving Paris, but the numbers have not been bad. With what feelings does his journey at PSG end?</h4>
        <p>With mixed feelings. The truth is that the first year was very difficult, as I have already said on occasion, for different reasons. The second year, the first six months I felt very, very good, very comfortable in the club, in the city, with my family. In the middle was the World Cup and I think the World Cup marked all the teams a bit in general, it marked the season a bit, with such an important competition in the middle for the first time. I think it conditioned the season a lot. I expected to end differently, but hey, it was two years, which, in general, were difficult for me, but they are behind me.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. We have also come to talk about Barça. How have you seen it? Have you missed it?</h4>
        <p>Yes, obviously yes, I missed. I was just saying, the truth is that the first year here for me was very difficult, after leaving, how it went and everything. Obviously that he followed him, that he watched the games and always longed for the memories and being able to be there.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. He has said that he has been following the games, I suppose he was happy like another culé when they won the League.</h4>
        <p>Yes, obviously yes. I followed him all year and I wanted Barça to win like all Barcelona fans. And the first year too. I talk a lot with Xavi, also about some games, after the game, about situations... The truth is that we talked a lot since he was coach. And he followed him, obviously.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. And regarding the possibility of returning, have you already made a decision?</h4>
        <p>Yes, the truth is, I obviously really wanted to, very excited to be able to return, but, on the other hand, after having experienced what I experienced and the exit I had, I did not want to be in the same situation again : wait to see what would happen and leave my future in someone else's hands, so to speak. I wanted to make my own decision, thinking about myself, about my family. Although I heard that it was said that LaLiga had accepted everything and that everything was fine for him to return, there were still many other things that had to be done. I heard that they had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that, or take charge of obtaining something that had to do with all that. I have already been accused of many things that were not true in my career at Barcelona and I was already a bit tired, I didn't want to go through all that. And well, the time I had to leave, LaLiga had also accepted that they sign me up and in the end it couldn't be done. Well, I was afraid that the same thing would happen again and I had to walk the bullfight as it happened, that I had to come here to Paris to stay in a hotel for a long time with my family, with my children going to school and still being in the hotel... I wanted to make my own decision and that's why it was a bit that I didn't turn to Barça. Although I would have loved it, it couldn't. I am also in a moment where I want to get out of focus a bit, think more about my family. As I was just saying, I spent two years at a family level that was so bad that I didn't enjoy it. I had the month that was spectacular for me for having won the World Cup, but removing that was a difficult stage for me.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Of all the reasons, which one weighed the most on you?</h4>
        <p>Having my own decision and not having to wait again and that the same thing that already happened could happen. As I was saying, after having achieved everything thanks to God and having finally achieved the World Cup, what I wanted so much, I also wanted to look for something else and a bit of peace of mind.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. What does your family tell you? Whenever they could they escaped to Barcelona…</h4>
        <p>My family was very excited about everything they heard, but at the same time we weren't so excited because the reality was that we still didn't know what could happen, but obviously they were eager to return. We never wanted to leave there, it was very difficult, but they also support me and it is a decision made as a family, not just mine. They are also happy about the new change, although also sad to leave. It was difficult at first but now they are more than adapted here in Paris. They have their friends at school and it also hurts to be separated from all that. They are already big. Above all, Thiago understands the situation and is happy about what will come.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. From the club they have said that it depended on you almost 99% and Xavi said that he had the upper hand, but something was missing for that offer, how did you live it?</h4>
        <p>I listened to a bit of everything that was said, what was coming out, what Xavi said... but it was a bit of what he was saying recently. LaLiga had given the OK but it is not real that the decision is mine because many things are missing and it is a long summer in which I do not want to go through what I already went through again. I preferred to make the decision earlier to end this and be calm and think about the holidays and my future, already planning what I know is going to be possible.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Have you felt pressured by the information coming from Barcelona?</h4>
        <p>No, because so many things came out. I don't know where they came from, but there were a lot of leaks and news. There were even journalists who put me everywhere. They confirmed it to me in Arabia, in Barcelona they took it for granted and the next day they changed their version. There was a lot of that going on, so I was trying to think about what I knew and felt and deal with that, not what was being said.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. How has what happened two years ago when you came back to sign and then saw that it couldn't be, having to uproot your family from Barcelona, ​​affect your decision?</h4>
        <p>It was very hard. One of the reasons I just explained is not to go through all that again. It was a very ugly stage. We arrived with the illusion of each year, of starting training again and the children with their schools and their routines. When everything was ready to sign, overnight, it couldn't be done and they tell me that it's not possible and I have to leave the club. I had to start running and look for a team, make a hasty decision and go through everything we went through that was hard.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Have these two years in Paris also ended up affecting the decision?</h4>
        <p>A bit yes, because as I recently said, there were two years in which I was not happy, I did not enjoy myself, and that affected my family life, I missed a lot of my children's lives at school. In Barcelona I went to look for them, here I did much less, shared fewer activities with them. The decision also goes through there, to meet again, in quotes, with my family, with my children, and enjoy the day to day. I was lucky to achieve everything in football and now it goes a little beyond sports, which also interests me, and much, much more the family.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Let's talk about President Laporta, about Xavi. Did they contact you? Was there dialogue throughout this process?</h4>
        <p>Actually, with President Laporta I spoke very little, once or twice at most. I do have a lot of communication with Xavi, since he arrived at the club much more, and very often. We also talked about the possibility of me coming back. We were very excited, because when something came out we would discuss if he really wanted him to come back, if it was good for the team and for him, and we kept in communication.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. During all this time your name has been chanted at the Camp Nou, in concerts... how have you experienced it?</h4>
        <p>For me it was beautiful and I enjoyed it, because the truth is that since I left, I left in a strange way, I would have liked to say goodbye as was done now with Busi, Jordi, or as happened to Xavi and Iniesta at the time. I would have liked to leave that way, to have been able to say goodbye to the people well, even though it was the time of the pandemic and there couldn't be people in the stadium. I would have liked to know that I was playing with people, to know that I was enjoying it. That is why I was very happy when I heard my name at the Camp Nou or in Barcelona. Beyond the fact that love is always there and is mutual, it was a strange feeling to hear him at the Camp Nou and not be there.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. To what extent has the economic issue been important in your decision? It was even commented that he would have played for Barcelona for free. That's right?</h4>
        <p>The truth is that economics was never a problem for me or an obstacle at all. We never even get to talk about the contract now. A proposal was passed over, but never a formal, written, signed proposal, because there was still nothing and we did not know if it was going to be possible or not. There was the intention, but we couldn't advance anything, we didn't even talk about money formally. If it had been a matter of money I would have gone to Arabia or elsewhere. It seemed like a lot of money to me and the truth is that my decision was for the other side and not for money.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Did you receive messages from Barcelona, leaks from the club...?</h4>
        <p>Well... Although I was excited as I said before, I accepted messages and leaks with enthusiasm when they were positive. I wasn't very excited either because I didn't really know what was going to happen and always remembering what had happened to me, telling my children and my family that we were going to return to Barcelona and then it wouldn't happen. So yes, I was pending, but calmly.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Do you think that Barcelona has done everything possible to sign you?</h4>
        <p>Well I don't know. It is their issue. Honestly, I don't know if he has done everything possible or not. I knew what he was talking about with Xavi, above all... Now they had, by what is said, obtained the permission of the League to be able to do it. But I'm telling you, it wasn't just that. Many things were missing. The club, today, was not in a position to confirm 100% that I could return. And it is understandable, due to the situation that the club is going through, and that is how I lived it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Do you think that there are people in the club who don't like you or who think that your presence could be a problem?</h4>
        <p>I don't know. But surely there are people who don't want me to come back, just as at the time they didn't want me to stay when I had to leave. Like many people I know who want me to come back and they expressed it and made it public. But surely there are people on the board who do not want me to return, who believe that my return is not good for the club.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Since his departure, Barça has signed. Shortly after his departure he signed Ferran for 55 million... did that seem strange to you?</h4>
        <p>I don't know... At the beginning I was at a time when I was very hurt by my departure and by how it happened. At that time, I was a bit angry that I couldn't stay and soon the club could make moves. But at that moment the club understood that it could do it. With the passing of these two years I understood it, assimilated it and I don't think about it anymore. If something like this was done, it should have been done that way, and that's it...</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Is yours with Barça an open wound that has not stopped bleeding?</h4>
        <p>A little yes, a little yes... From what I said before. For not being able to say goodbye to people as I would have liked. As I think I would have deserved. As the players I named also deserved and did. I would have liked to go that way. On one side there was an ugly runrún. I had been the bad guy in the movie and I didn't like that very much either because it hadn't been like that. That's why I would like to have a real farewell at some point with the people we lived and enjoyed and suffered so much. They were many years together, and I would like to say goodbye as I feel.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. Speaking of this injury, would you like to return to Barça one day? As technical secretary, player, ambassador...</h4>
        <p>Yes, obviously I would like to be close to the club. What's more, I'm going to live in Barcelona. It is one of the things that we have very clear with my wife, my children. Hopefully, I don't know when or when but hopefully one day I can contribute something to the club and help because it is a club that I love as I always said. I appreciate the love I had from people during my career and I would like to be here again, yes.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. During these last few months, we assume that you have lived with some anxiety. Is there something that has hurt you in particular or has he thought that this could have been saved?</h4>
        <p>As I said before, so many things have been said, so many things leaked, so many lies that were told but I cannot go out and deny everything that is said but I see that there are many journalists who tell many lies and are portrayed and nothing happens. The next day they tell another lie again and nothing happens. Yes, there were many things that bothered me, for example, when they talk a lot about my family, that it was said that my son had had a bad time when it was the opposite. My children do not want to leave here because of how well they are. When they mess with my family and start talking about things they talk about without knowing if it bothers me a little and more than anything that, that they talk and lie.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. The other key question. After knowing that he will not return to Barcelona, ​where are his steps headed? To Saudi Arabia, what has been said too? To Miami? To another place?</h4>
        <p>I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami. I still haven't closed it one hundred percent. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue the path.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. This Miami thing is new. Is Busquets being taken there? Does he go with you there?</h4>
        <p>That is one of the other things that was said, that I was going with Busi and Jordi to Arabia, that we already had everything arranged. No, each one looks for his future. Obviously, I was aware of them and what they were going to do, but we never agreed to go anywhere together. I made my decision for myself and I don't know what they are going to do. Mine was a bit thinking about everything we talked about in this interview and I have nothing armed with anyone.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Q. When you say you want to get out of focus, what do you mean? That he wants to get out of the spotlight, out of high competition...?</h4>
        <p>Leaving Europe. I had offers from other European teams but I didn't even evaluate them because my idea was to go to Barcelona and if the Barcelona thing didn't come out, analyzing it, then leaving European football and much more after winning the World Cup, which was what I needed to Closing my career on this side and living the United States League in a different way and enjoying day to day much more but with the same responsibility of wanting to win and always doing things well but with more peace of mind.</p>
